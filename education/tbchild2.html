<h4 class="auto-style10">As for me, I find it easier to learn English in different ways. It is boring for me to learn English only writting or reading with teacher. I like combining different interesting learning ways to make my studying easier and better. My teacher helps me with it and it's cool. I think I haven't the most effective language learning method. I use different methods like reading, listening, writting, talking. My favourite is reading. Especially I like reading funny and artistic stories. So, in the end I want to advise you to learn English because it's very interesting. And if you have not studied it yet, you've lost a lot.</h4>
